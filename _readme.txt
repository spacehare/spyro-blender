sky meshes converted and rendered into 6-sided TGA skyboxes by Rabbit

some skies might have small errors like sharp edges instead of smooth gradients; according to the readme from the links below, this is an error with the ripping process.
i don't know how to rip the skies myself, so i tried to manually repaint certain issue-areas manually. i might have missed some, and i apologize for that. this also means that the skies are not as "authentic" as i would ideally like... but what can ya do
